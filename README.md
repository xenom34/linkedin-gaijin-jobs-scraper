```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/linkedin-gaijin-jobs-scraper.git
cd linkedin-gaijin-jobs-scraper
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash

```

3. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project with your LinkedIn credentials:
```
LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your_password
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Running the Main Script

```bash
python linkedin_scraper.py
```

The script will:
1. Log in to LinkedIn with your credentials
2. Search for jobs according to the configured criteria
3. Analyze each job to determine if it is suitable for foreigners
4. Export the results in different formats

### Command Line Options

You can customize the execution with the following options:

```bash
python linkedin_scraper.py --pages 10 --keywords "Data Engineer,Machine Learning,AI" --location "Osaka, Japan" --language en
```

| Option | Description | Default Value |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| `--pages` | Number of pages to scrape | 5 |
| `--keywords` | Search keywords (comma-separated) | Technical Consultant,Software Consultant,Professional Services |
| `--location` | Search location | Tokyo, Japan |
| `--language`, `-l` | Application language (en: English, fr: French) | en |

### Advanced Customization

For more advanced modifications, you can directly edit the source code. The main configuration functions are located in the `main()` function of the `linkedin_scraper.py` file.

## üìä Results

The results are exported to the `exports/` folder in different formats:

- **CSV**: Raw data for analysis
- **Excel**: Formatted table with conditional formatting
- **HTML**: Interactive report with charts and filters

Each job contains the following information:
- Job title
- Company
- Location
- Job URL
- "Gaijin-friendly" compatibility score
- Detailed scores by category
- Detected leave days
- Expatriate benefits

## üß© Project Structure

- `linkedin_scraper.py`: Main script for scraping and analysis
- `linkedin_export.py`: Module for exporting data in different formats
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies
- `exports/`: Folder containing exported files

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The analysis of job listings is based on a multi-criteria scoring system:

1. **Analysis of Japanese language requirements** (detects mentions of JLPT, "native level", etc.)
2. **Evaluation of international environment** (mentions of international team, working language, etc.)
3. **Analysis of expatriate benefits** (visa, housing, etc.)
4. **Review of leave policies** (leave days, flexibility, etc.)
5. **Detection of language** used in the listing (an English listing is generally more suitable)

Each criterion contributes to an overall score that determines if the job is "gaijin-friendly".
